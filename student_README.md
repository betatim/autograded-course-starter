# Week 1 assignment

Welcome to the week 1 assignment.

To get feedback on your homework while you work on it and to make sure
your notebook looks as you would expect it when the grading bot runs it
there are a few things you need to setup:

1. Visit https://github.com/apps/notebookbot and enable it for this repository
2. Sign up for an account with CircleCI using your GitHub credentials
3. Visit https://circleci.com/dashboard
4. Click "Add Projects"
5. Find this repository in the list, once you have found it
6. Click the blue button on the right "Set Up Project"
7. The next page lets you configure and change a lot of things, however the
   defaults are what we need. Find the "Start Building" button at the bottom
   right and click it.
